# Primer.style

Primer is GitHub's design system. The [primer.style](https://primer.style/) website will, overtime, be the hub from which all Primer web properties are linked from. We're working on updating our websites, domains, and npm package names so that it will be easier in future to find all things Primer.

We'll be making improvements and additions to this site over the coming months, but we welcome feedback and contributions. Please check existing issues and pull requests before contributing, and please communicate via an issue first if you intend to make large-scale changes. See [contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md) for more info.
